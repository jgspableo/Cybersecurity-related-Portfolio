During a controlled internal penetration test on a single Kali VM (attacker and simulated targets on 127.0.0.1), I assessed a lab environment containing a PHP upload directory and a TCP Echo service. Recon (Nmap) identified the web surface, and exploitation used a PHP Meterpreter reverse shell served by the PHP built-in server; triggering the payload yielded a Meterpreter session as user webuser and access to sensitive data (flag.txt). Post-exploitation validated system context (UID/GID, kernel) but did not attempt persistence or credential harvesting. The key risk is a remote code execution via malicious file upload—uploads were executable inside the web root—rated Critical (CVSS v3.1 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Recommended actions: store uploads outside the web root or disable execution in the uploads path, implement strict allow-list/MIME checks, harden service permissions, and add monitoring to alert on executable files in upload locations.
